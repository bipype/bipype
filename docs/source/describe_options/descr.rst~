==============================
DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM OPTIONS
==============================

Bipype is a very useful program, which prepare a lot of types of bioinformatics analyses.
There are three input options: amplicons, WGS (whole genome sequences) and metatranscriptomic data. If amplicons are input data, then bipype does reconstruction and pairs merging. After that biodiversity is searching. There are two types of searching depending on the amplicons types (ITS or 16S).
If WGS are chosen, then bipype finds the SA coordinates of the input reads and generates alignments in the SAM format given single-end reads, aligns reads to reference sequence(s).
All of these analyses will be shown with Krona program, which allows to show hierarchical data with pie charts.


bipype stands for bioinformatics-python-pipe.

Proposed analysis
------------------------

Below are listed a few analysis which could be performed with bipype program.
As input for all following analysis FASTA files should be given.

Metagenomics

* **Analysis 1**

..code-block:: bash
	:linelos:
	bipype -m run -rapsearch rap_KEGG -humann
	bipype -m -run --order prepare_taxonomy_stats -ot txt

* **Analysis 2**

This analysis can be done in the same way as presented in case of analysis of amplicons.

^^^^^^^^^
Amplicons
^^^^^^^^^

* **Both (16S and ITS)**
